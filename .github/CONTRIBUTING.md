# Pagy Contributions

Pull Requests are welcome!

Here are a few useul information for you:

1. If you are planning for a complex PR, we suggest that you check before hand whether your
   proposed changes are going to be accepted by posting your ideas in
   the [Feature Requests](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/discussions/categories/feature-requests) discussion area
2. For adding translations of locale dictionary files please follow
   the [locales  readme instructions here.](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/blob/master/gem/locales/README.md).
3. **Development**
    - Please base your PR against the `master` branch (creating your own branch out of it)
    - You can have a decent development environment already setup by just using one of the apps in
    the [Pagy Playground](https://ddnexus.github.io/pagy/playground) and/or
    with the [Pagy::Console](https://ddnexus.github.io/pagy/docs/api/console/) directly from the repo
4. **Testing**
    - If your PR **does not add any new feature** (e.g. a fix), please, just ensure that the "All checks have passed" indicator
    gets green light on the PR page (if it's not enabled, a maintainer will enable it for you)
    - If your PR **adds new features**, it needs ruby testing and/or E2E testing or the coverage will fail. You can check how
    the [Test environment](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy/tree/master/test) works and use it, or ask for support

Thank you!
