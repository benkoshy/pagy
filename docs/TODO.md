# TO DO
- [] Check the description that appears in the categories pages. 
  - Since retype uses the first few words of the first paragraph, we should reduce the exceeding first paragraphs so it will not look truncated in the category description 
- [] Refactor the description of `Pagy::Backend` 
- [] Refactor the description of `Pagy::I18n` (translation + localization) 
- [] Refactor of `index.md`: Rewrite the content... eventually moving part out or the README.
- [] Refactoring of How To: Try the panels or split in sup pages?
- [] Reorganize ALL the content with retype tabs, panels, columns, alert, warnings, notes etc.
