# TO DO
- [] Check the description that appears in the categories pages. 
  - Since retype uses the first few words of the first paragraph, we should reduce the exceeding first paragraphs so it will not look truncated in the category description 
- [] Refactor the description of `Pagy::Backend` 
- [] Refactor the description of `Pagy::I18n` (translation + localization) 
- [] Refactor of `index.md`: Rewrite the content... eventually moving part out or the README.
- [] Refactoring of How To: Try the panels or split in sup pages?
- [] Reorganize ALL the content with retype tabs, panels, columns, alert, warnings, notes etc.


### Nice to have:

- [] Add pictures of the various helpers to help people visualise what a helper looks like. e.g. `pagy_bulma_nav_js(pagy, ...)` - what does this look like again? Like this: show pic.
